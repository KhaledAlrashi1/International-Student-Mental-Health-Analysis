# Student Mental Health Analysis
![Mental Health](mental_health.jpg)

## Overview
The project focuses on understanding the impact of studying abroad on students' mental health. Using a dataset from a study conducted by a Japanese international university in 2018, the analysis aims to explore the mental health challenges faced by international students. This dataset includes variables such as types of students (international or domestic), language proficiency, academic level, age, length of stay, total score of depression (PHQ-9 test), social connectedness (SCS test), and acculturative stress (ASISS test). The primary objectives are to investigate the relationship between social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression among international students, and to examine if the length of stay or the student's age influences these mental health outcomes.
